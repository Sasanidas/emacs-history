## Provenance

- TECO EMACS 162 from Alfred M. Szmidt.

  `ai-emacs.tgz` and `ai-emacs1.tgz`
  "Based on AI EMACS; LOCK timestamp:
  1988-03-02 or there abouts"

  "This is for ITS (from the AI system), I think the one on MC is the
  same I can check if you really are curious, and this should be 162
  but lack of version strings and what not make it interesting"

- emacs-v170.tap from Richard Alderson.

  TOPS-20 `DUMP` tape image of TECO EMACS.  Extracted in
  http://github.com/PDP-10/emacs/tree/extracted

- MIT CADR Zwei from Alfred M. Szmidt and Brad Parker.

  `nzwei-mit-48.tar.xz`
  "Based on zmacs.lisp time stamp:
  1980-10-17 or there abouts"

  `zwei-mit-78.tar.xz`
  "Based on the System patch-dir file
  ;;; Written 1/11/82 13:52:10 by BSG"

  `zwei-mit-99.tar.xz`
  "Based on zmacs.lisp timestamp:
  1985-04-13 or there abouts"

  "This is for MIT CADR, copies come from tapes for the MIT CADR
  system, and some backups that Brad Parker found several years
  ago (NN is the version of the system)"

- TI Explorer Zmacs 6 from Alfred M. Szmidt.

  `zmacs-ti-6.tar.xz` (System 6)
  "Based on zmacs.lisp time stamp:
  1980-10-17 or there abouts"

  "This is for TI Explorer (N is the version of Zmacs, not the
  operating system -- even though they are the same)"

- Emacs 13.8 from http://decuslib.com/decus/vax85b/gnuemax/emacs/

  Possibly with VMS modifications.

- emacs-16.56.tar.gz from ftp://ftp.splode.com/pub/users/friedman/emacs/

  Noah Friedman: "In 1993 I recovered a copy of the Emacs 16.56
  sources from backup tapes at MIT because rms needed it in a court
  case with Unisys.  I put it back up for ftp a couple of years later
  and it's relatively easy to find these days."

  GNU Emacs for NeXT systems.  This is a version of 18.55, plus RMS
  changes up until July 1990.  This is interesting, because stock
  18.55 was released in August 1989, and 18.56 in January 1991.

- gosling-emacs-1999.tar and gosling-emacs-2007.tar from http://brian.org/~reid/misc

  Brian Reid: "I found two versions.
  They are in  reid.org/~brian/misc/gosling-emacs-1999.tar
     and       reid.org/~brian/misc/gosling-emacs-2007.tar

  In 1999 I updated it so it would work with gcc 2
  In 2007 I paid some Russian kid to update it so that it would work
  with gcc 3
  When gcc 4 came out it would no longer compile, and I just sort of
  walked away from it."

  "I got the source from you in 1983. I did a little bit
  of work on it so it would run under 4.3BSD. It was then untouched
  until gcc 2.0 came out; I had to change every variable-argument
  function call.

  So my 1999 version is identical to your 1983 version except for
  those two things."

  About publishing the files:

  Brian Reid: "Fine with me. I consider them to be James' property and not my own."

  James Gosling: "Itâ€™s fine with me too. Archaeology is a good thing :-)"
