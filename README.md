Run the `build.sh` script to create a git repository with all Emacs
releases.

## Provenance

- emacs-v170.tap from Richard Alderson.

  TOPS-20 `DUMP` tape image of TECO EMACS.  Not included in the git
  repository.  Extracted in http://github.com/PDP-10/emacs/tree/extracted

- emacs-16.56.tar.gz from Noah Friedman.

  "In 1993 I recovered a copy of the Emacs 16.56 sources from backup
  tapes at MIT because rms needed it in a court case with Unisys.  I
  put it back up for ftp a couple of years later and it's relatively
  easy to find these days."

  Brian Reid: "I found two versions.
  They are in  reid.org/~brian/misc/gosling-emacs-1999.tar
     and       reid.org/~brian/misc/gosling-emacs-2007.tar

  In 1999 I updated it so it would work with gcc 2
  In 2007 I paid some Russian kid to update it so that it would work
  with gcc 3
  When gcc 4 came out it would no longer compile, and I just sort of
  walked away from it."

  "I got the source from you in 1983. I did a little bit
  of work on it so it would run under 4.3BSD. It was then untouched
  until gcc 2.0 came out; I had to change every variable-argument
  function call.

  So my 1999 version is identical to your 1983 version except for
  those two things."

  About publishing the files:

  Brian Reid: "Fine with me. I consider them to be James' property and not my own."

  James Gosling: "Itâ€™s fine with me too. Archaeology is a good thing :-)"
