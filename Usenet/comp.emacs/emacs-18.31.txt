GNU Emacs 18.31 is now available in the usual place.

The VMS newline problems are believed to be fixed.
The remaining unsolved problems include a failure of unexec
on some kinds of V.2.2 systems (but not on all),
possibly some nonfatal problems with X (one report that
C-g takes effect synchronously under X),
and many things that don't work on VMS because they use
subprocesses on Unix.

The differences from 18.30 are around 200k.

I suspect that something was corrupted in the 18.26 to 18.30 diffs,
or else they are installed incorrectly by patch.  Please do not
propagate Emacs 18.30 distributions that were made by updating from
18.26.  In particular, don't continue updating them.  I suggest that
you get a new full distribution.
