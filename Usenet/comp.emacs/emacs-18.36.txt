GNU Emacs version 18.36 is now available for testing in the
usual places on prep.  Diffs from 18.35 are 240k.
Version 18 is still considered a test version because
there are still a few machines that 17 ran on but 18 does not.

This version mainly fixes a lot of bugs, including one
garbage collection bug that affected only certain machines
including the RT/PC.  If you found Emacs 18 crashed while loading
the predefined Lisp code, it is worth seeing if 18.36 fixes
the problem.
