Emacs 18.52 is now available on prep.ai.mit.edu in
/u/emacs/edist.tar-18.52.Z.  This file is around 4 meg.

Compressed differences from 18.51 are in /u/emacs/diff-18.51-18.52.Z.
They are 542000 bytes.

This is the last release of Emacs I intend to make before version 19.
The first test releases of version 19 will probably be in 6 to 9
months.  Version 19 already has support for multiple X windows,
per-buffer mouse commands, scroll bars, and European character sets.
I don't know what other new features it will have.
