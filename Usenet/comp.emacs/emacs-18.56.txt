Emacs 18.56 is now available for anonymous ftp from
/u/emacs/emacs-18.56.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu.

This versione exists mainly to fix bugs, and to eliminate any vestige
of resemblance with Gosmacs.  However, there is a new feature: the
undo code has been completely rewritten, and you can now specify just
how much undo data should be kept for each buffer.

There is a new release of the Emacs Lisp manual as well.

I don't think there will be diffs from 18.55, because the changes are
so large and pervasive that the diffs might be larger than the
distribution.  However, if this proves not to be true, I will make
some diffs, but it will not happen until a week from now.  Perhaps it
would work to use the src directory verbatim but make diffs for
everything else.
