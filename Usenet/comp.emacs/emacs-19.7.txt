	[ Please use one of the ftp sites mentioned in the list at the
	  end, instead of prep.ai.mit.edu.  Because GNU Emacs 19 is a large
	  and long awaited program, prep.ai.mit.edu will be very
	  loaded and unresponsive, and everyone will do better using
	  one of the mirror sites.

	  GNU Emacs 19 will join GNU Emacs 18 on FSF's Emacs tape.
	  It will NOT be on the Experimental tape.  If you are
	  ordering an Emacs tape within the next month to get a beta
	  release of GNU Emacs 19, please make a note of this on your
	  order.

	  Thank You, g...@prep.ai.mit.edu

Version 19.7 of GNU Emacs is now available for beta-testing via
anonymous FTP from prep.ai.mit.edu, as `pub/gnu/emacs-19.7.tar.z'.


Emacs 19's new features include:

* multiple X windows (`frames' to Emacs), with a separate X window for
  the minibuffer, or with a minibuffer attached to each X window,
* property lists for characters in buffers and strings,
* multiple fonts, color, and underlining, defined by those properties,
* X selection processing, including CLIPBOARD selections,
* simplified and improved processing of function keys, mouse clicks,
  and mouse motion,
* menu bars and popup menus defined by keymaps,
* scrollbars, and 
* support for European character sets.


At the lisp level, Emacs 19 supports:

* before and after change hooks,
* source-level debugging of Emacs Lisp programs,
* floating point numbers,
* improved buffer allocation, using a new mechanism capable of
  returning storage to the system when a buffer is killed,
* interfacing with the X resource manager, and 
* support for the GNU configuration scheme.


Many popular lisp packages are now part of the standard distribution,
including:
* the comint modes (CMUshell and friends),
* the extended byte compiler,
* the GNUS newsreader,
* the lisp source-level debugger, and
* the VC version control system.


Thanks are due to:
* the Emacs 19 alpha-testers,
* Jamie Zawinski and the Lucid folks for their implementation of some of
  the X-related features, and
* Alan Carroll and the people who worked on Epoch for generating
  initial feedback to a multi-windowed Emacs.
