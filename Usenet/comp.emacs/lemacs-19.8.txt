Lucid GNU Emacs 19.8 is now available.  This is a version of GNU Emacs derived
from an early version of Emacs version 19 from the Free Software Foundation.

(If you are already a user of version 19.6, you might want to skip ahead to
the section labeled "Differences Between 19.6 and 19.8".)

You can get it via anonymous FTP from LUCID.COM (192.43.175.3).

Note that the IP address of LUCID.COM changed in mid-July, 1993; if you cannot
connect, check to see that you are picking up the correct address.

Log in with the user "anonymous" and "username@host" as a password (that is,
your email address.)  Execute the command "cd /pub/lemacs/".  These are the
files you will find there:

  lemacs-19.8.tar.gz
	The complete source distribution.  This file is about 7 megabytes.
	When unpacked, the source distribution will take up about 25 megs.
	You will need an additional 12 megs or so to compile it.

  lemacs-19.8-sun4.tar.gz
	This is the same as lemacs-19.8.tar.gz, plus the addition of a set
	of ready-to-run executables for SunOS 4.1.  This file is about 9.5
	megs.  When unpacked, the lemacs tree will take up about 31 megs.
	This version of lemacs is compiled with support for Motif dialog
	boxes and XPM files.

  xpm-3.2f.tar.gz
	The XPM library (optional.)


Files with extension `.gz' have been packed with `gzip', the GNU compression
utility.  The distribution directory also contains copies of these files in
the Unix `compress' format, ending in `.Z'.  The contents of the archives are
the same, but the `.Z' files are about 30% larger.

Don't forget to set "binary" mode when transferring these files.  Unpack them
with some variation of the command "zcat lemacs-19.8.tar.Z | tar -pvxf -".

You can also purchase Lucid Emacs tapes and manuals directly from Lucid.
Call (800) 223-9322 or send mail to lucid...@lucid.com for current pricing,
media, and platform information.

We have created two mailing lists for discussing our Emacs.

   bug-luc...@lucid.com	For reporting all bugs in Lucid GNU Emacs,
				including bugs in the compilation and
				installation procedures.

   help-luc...@lucid.com	For random questions and conversation
				about using Lucid GNU Emacs.

To be added or removed from these mailing lists, send mail to 
bug-lucid-e...@lucid.com or help-lucid-e...@lucid.com.

The bug-lucid-emacs and help-lucid-emacs mailing lists are archived in the 
directory /pub/mlists/, and are bidirectionally gatewayed into the newsgroups
alt.lucid-emacs.bug and alt.lucid-emacs.help.

Please do not send messages about problems with Lucid GNU Emacs to the FSF
GNU Emacs newsgroups and mailing lists (help-gn...@prep.ai.mit.edu,
bug-gn...@prep.ai.mit.edu, gnu.emacs.help, gnu.emacs.bug, et cetera)
unless you are sure that the problem you are reporting is a problem with
both versions of GNU Emacs.  People who aren't subscribed to the Lucid GNU
Emacs mailing lists most likely are not interested in hearing about problems
with it.


Why Another Version of Emacs?
=============================

Lucid's latest product, Energize, is a C/C++ development environment.  Rather
than invent (and force our users to learn) a new user-interface, we chose to
build part of our environment on top of the world's best editor, GNU Emacs.
(Though our product is commercial, the work we did on GNU Emacs is free
software, and is useful without having to purchase our product.)

We needed a version of Emacs with mouse-sensitive regions, multiple fonts,
the ability to mark sections of a buffer as read-only, the ability to detect
which parts of a buffer has been modified, and many other features.

Why Not Epoch or FSF19?
=======================

For our purposes, the existing version of Epoch was not sufficient; it did
not allow us to put arbitrary pixmaps/icons in buffers, `undo' did not
restore changes to regions, regions did not overlap and merge their
attributes in the way we needed, and several other things.

We could have devoted our time to making Epoch do what we needed (and, in
fact, we spent some time doing that in 1990) but, since the FSF planned to 
include Epoch-like features in their version 19, we decided that our efforts
would be better spent improving Emacs 19 instead of Epoch.  

Our original hope was that our changes to Emacs would be incorporated into
the "official" v19.  However, scheduling conflicts arose, and we found that,
given the amount of work still remaining to be done, we didn't have the time
or manpower to do the level of coordination that would be necessary to get
our changes accepted by the FSF.  Consequently, we released our work as a
forked branch of Emacs, instead of delaying any longer.

Roughly a year after Lucid Emacs 19.0 was released, a beta version of the FSF
branch of Emacs 19 was released.  The FSF version is better in some areas, and
worse in others, as reflects the differing focus of our development efforts.

We plan to continue developing and supporting Lucid Emacs, and merging in bug
fixes and new features from the FSF branch as appropriate; we do not plan to
discard any of the functionality that we implemented which RMS has chosen not
to include in his version.

Certain elements of Lucid Emacs, or derivatives of them, have been ported to
the FSF version.  We have not been doing work in this direction, because we
feel that Lucid Emacs has a cleaner and more extensible substrate, and that
any kind of merger between the two branches would be far easier by merging
the FSF changes into our version than the other way around.

We have been working closely with the Epoch developers to merge in the
remaining Epoch functionality which Lucid Emacs does not yet have.  Epoch
and Lucid Emacs will soon be one and the same thing.  Work is being done on
a compatibility package which will allow Epoch 4 code to run in Lemacs with
little or no change.  (As of 19.8, Lucid Emacs is running a descendant of
the Epoch redisplay engine.)

No Warranty
===========

Lucid Emacs is distributed under exactly the same terms as GNU Emacs, and
thus has no warranty of any kind.

However, if you have received this version of Emacs with Energize, then it is
covered by your Energize support contract.  If you have received it through
some other means, then you may buy a support contract for it from Lucid.
Send mail to lucid...@lucid.com for more information about Lucid Emacs or
Energize.

What's Different?
=================

Unless otherwise noted, this file describes differences between Lucid Emacs
version 19.* and GNU Emacs version 18.57.

Lucid Emacs *currently* requires an X Window System environment to run,
though it will not be much work to make it run on dumb ttys again.  We plan
to do this eventually.  If you would like to volunteer to help, send us mail.

Because of our functionality requirements and manpower constraints, we have
not been able to spend as much time on portability issues as we would like;
consequently, Lucid Emacs is not necessarily as easy to bring up on other
systems as the other branches of Emacs are.  We are very eager to get feedback
about portability problems from those who compile it on other systems.

We have reimplemented the basic input model in a more general way; instead of
X input being a special-case of the normal ASCII input stream, Emacs has a
concept of "input events", and ASCII characters are a subset of that.  The
events that Emacs knows about are not X events, but are a generalization of
them, so that Emacs can eventually be ported to different window systems.

We have reimplemented keymaps so that sequences of events can be stored into
them instead of just ASCII codes; it is possible to, for example, bind
different commands to each of the chords Control-h, Control-H, Backspace,
Control-Backspace, and Super-Shift-Backspace.  Key bindings, function key
bindings, and mouse bindings live in the same keymaps.

Input and display of all ISO-8859-1 characters is supported.

You can have multiple X windows ("screens" in lemacs terminology).

Our Emacs has objects called "extents" and "faces", which are roughly
analogous to Epoch's "buttons," "zones," and "styles."  An extent is a region
of text (a start position and an end position) and a face is a collection of
textual attributes like fonts and colors.  Every extent is displayed in some
"face", so changing the properties of a face immediately updates the display 
of all associated extents.  Faces can be screen-local: you can have a region
of text which displays with completely different attributes when its buffer
is viewed from a different X window.

The display attributes of faces may be specified either in lisp or through
the X resource manager.

Variable width fonts work.

The height of a line is the height of the tallest font on that line, instead
of all lines having the same height.

Emacs use the MIT "Xt" toolkit instead of raw Xlib calls, which makes it be
a more well-behaved X citizen (and also improves portability).  A result of
this is that it is possible to include other Xt "Widgets" in the Emacs
window.  Also, Emacs understands the standard Xt command-line arguments.

Emacs understands the X11 "Selection" mechanism; it's possible to define
and customize selection converter functions and new selection types from 
elisp, without having to recompile Emacs.

Emacs now supports the Zmacs/Lispm style of region highlighting, where the
region between the point and mark is highlighted when in its "active" state.

Emacs has a menubar, whose contents are customizable from emacs-lisp.
This menubar looks Motif-ish, but does not require Motif.  If you already
own Motif, however, you can configure Emacs to use a *real* Motif menubar
instead.  If you have OLIT ("OpenLook Intrinsics"), you can use an
OpenWindows-like menubar.

Emacs can ask questions using popup dialog boxes.  Any command executed from
a menu will ask yes/no questions with dialog boxes, while commands executed
via the keyboard will use the minibuffer.

The initial load-path is computed at run-time, instead of at compile-time.
This means that if you move the Emacs executable and associated directories
to somewhere else, you don't have to recompile anything.

You can specify what the title of the Emacs windows and icons should be
with the variables `screen-title-format' and `screen-icon-title-format',
which have the same syntax as `mode-line-format'.

Emacs now supports floating-point numbers.

Emacs now knows about timers directly, instead of them being simulated by
a subprocess.

Emacs understands truenames, and can be configured to notice when you are
visiting two names of the same file.

If you're running on a machine with audio hardware, you can specify sound 
files for Emacs to play instead of the default X beep.

Much more detail about the differences between Lucid Emacs and Emacs 18 can
be found in the file .../etc/NEWS (accessible with ``C-h n''.)

Note that building Lucid Emacs requires an ANSI C compiler, like gcc, or
Lucid's own (and the galaxy's best) Lucid C/C++.


Major Differences Between 19.6 and 19.8
=======================================

There were almost no differences between versions 19.6 and 19.7; version 19.7
was a bug-fix release that was distributed with Energize 2.1.

Lucid Emacs 19.8 represents the first stage of the Lucid Emacs/Epoch merger.
The redisplay engine now in lemacs is an improved descendant of the Epoch
redisplay.  As a result, many bugs have been eliminated, and several disabled
features have been re-enabled.  Notably:

Selective display (and outline-mode) work.

Horizontally split windows work.

The height of a line is the height of the tallest font displayed on that line;
it is possible for a screen to display lines of differing heights. (Previously,
the height of all lines was the height of the tallest font loaded.)

There is lisp code to scale fonts up and down, for example, to load the next-
taller version of a font.

There is a new internal representation for lisp objects, giving emacs-lisp 28
bit integers and a 28 bit address space, up from the previous maximum of 26.
We expect eventually to increase this to 30 bit integers and a 32 bit address
space, eliminating the need for DATA_SEG_BITS on some architectures.  (On 64
bit machines, add 32 to all of these numbers.)

GC performance is improved.

Various X objects (fonts, colors, cursors, pixmaps) are accessible as first-
class lisp objects, with finalization.

When using XPM files, one can specify the values of logical color names to be
used when loading the files.

It is possible to resize windows by dragging their modelines up and down.  More
generally, it is possible to add bindings for mouse gestures on the modelines.

There is support for playing sound files on HP machines.

ILISP version 5.5 is included.

The Common Lisp #' read syntax is supported (#' is to "function" as ' is to
"quote".)

The `active-p' slot of menu items is now evaluated, so one can put arbitrary
lisp code in a menu to decide whether that item should be selectable, rather
than doing this with an `activate-menubar-hook'.

The X resource hierarchy has changed slightly, to be more consistent.  It used
to be
 	argv[0]			SCREEN-NAME	pane	screen
  	ApplicationShell	EmacsShell	Paned	EmacsScreen

   now it is

	argv[0]			shell		pane	SCREEN-NAME
	ApplicationShell	EmacsShell	Paned	EmacsScreen

The Lucid Emacs sources have been largely merged with FSF version 19; this
means that the lisp library contains the most recent releases of various
packages, and many new features of FSF 19 have been incorporated.

Because of this, the lemacs sources should also be substantially more portable.

Please read the NEWS file (C-h n) for more information about these changes.

(No scrollbars yet, but they will be in 19.9.)
