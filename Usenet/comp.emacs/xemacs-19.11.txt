Subject: XEmacs 19.11 released (formerly Lucid Emacs)
Date: 14 Sep 1994 02:22:51 GMT
Organization: University of Illinois at Urbana

XEmacs 19.11 is now available.  This is a version of GNU Emacs derived from
Emacs version 19 from the Free Software Foundation.

There have been a number of administrative changes since the 19.10 release.
All users are encouraged to read these notes completely (with the exception of
the installation instructions.)

You can get it via anonymous FTP from CS.UIUC.EDU (128.174.252.1).

Log in with the user "anonymous" and "username@host" as a password (that is,
your email address.)  Execute the command "cd /pub/xemacs/".  There you will
find a number of files, only a subset of which you need.

CS.UIUC.EDU is the canonical distribution point and has an excellent net
connection, but only allows 20 connections at a time; you may want to get it
from one of the mirror sites instead, such as:

	self.stanford.edu		/pub/xemacs/
	ftp.uu.net			/systems/gnu/xemacs/
	ftp.ai.mit.edu			/pub/xemacs/
	liasun3.epfl.ch			/pub/gnu/xemacs/
	ftp.cenatls.cena.dgac.fr	/pub/Emacs/xemacs/
	ftp.germany.eu.net		/pub/X11/misc/xemacs
	ftp.th-darmstadt.de		/pub/editors/xemacs/
	audrey.levels.unisa.edu.au	/xemacs/
	ftp.center.osaka-u.ac.jp	/xemacs/
	ftp.technion.ac.il		/pub/unsupported/gnu/xemacs/

It may take a few days for the files to propogate to all of the mirrors.
(Mirror sites are encouraged to automatically check cs.uiuc.edu.)

The complete list of mirror sites, the current FAQ, and several other XEmacs
related items can be found at the brand new XEmacs World Wide Web page:

There are three types of tar files which comprise the xemacs distribution:

 - A tar file containing a source tree, for building xemacs from scratch;
 - A tar file containing the architecture-independent parts of a xemacs
   installation tree (which contains only those files which are needed at
   run-time, and excludes much of the source code);
 - And several tar files containing the architecture-dependent parts of a
   xemacs installation tree (the executables themselves.)

If you intend to build xemacs from source, all you need is the single source
distribution tar file.

If you intend to install the precompiled binaries for a single architecture,
then you need two tar files: both the architecture-independent and the 
architecture-dependent parts of the installation tree.  

If you intend to install the precompiled binaries for more than one
architecture, then you need three or more tar files: the single tar file of
the architecture-independent parts of the installation tree, and the tar files
of the architecture-dependent parts for the architectures you want.

  README
	This file.

  xemacs-19.11.tar.gz
	The complete source distribution.  This file is about 10 megabytes.
	When unpacked, the source distribution will take up about 36 megs.
	You will need an additional 12 megs or so to compile it.

  README.executables
	Installation instructions for the precompiled binaries.  It's
	important that you read this before unpacking the executables.

  xemacs-19.11-common.tar.gz
	This contains the architecture-independent parts of the installation
	tree.  If you intend to build xemacs from scratch, you do not need
	this file: it contains a subset of the files included in
	xemacs-19.11.tar.gz but arranged in a different directory structure
	(the files are arranged as an installation tree rather than a build
	tree.)  If you intend to install the precompiled binaries, you need
	this file in addition to the binary kit(s).

  xemacs-19.11-sparc-sun-sunos4.1.3.tar.gz
	This contains a set of ready-to-run executables for SunOS 4.1.3.
	NOTE: you need to get xemacs-19.11-common.tar.gz as well for these to
	work.  See README.executables.

  xemacs-19.11-sparc-sun-sunos4.1.3-sparcworks.tar.gz
  	This set contains a set of ready-to-run executables for SunOS 4.1.3,
	plus support for Sun's SparcWorks development environment.  If you do
	not own SparcWorks, then these binaries do not add any features that
	you can take advantage of.  NOTE: you need to get
	xemacs-19.11-common.tar.gz as well for these to work.  See
	README.executables.

  xemacs-19.11-sparc-sun-solaris2.3.tar.gz
	This contains a set of ready-to-run executables for SunOS 5.3,
	otherwise known as Solaris 2.3.  NOTE: you need to get
	xemacs-19.11-common.tar.gz as well for these to work.  See
	README.executables.

  xemacs-19.11-sparc-sun-solaris2.3-sparcworks.tar.gz
  	This set contains a set of ready-to-run executables for SunOS 5.3,
	otherwise known as Solaris 2.3, plus support for Sun's SparcWorks
	development environment.  If you do not own SparcWorks, then these
	binaries do not add any features that you can take advantage of.
	NOTE: you need to get xemacs-19.11-common.tar.gz as well for these to
	work.  See README.executables.

  xemacs-19.11-m68k-hp-hpux9.tar.gz
	Executables for HP9000/300s and HP9000/400s with HPUX 8 or 9.

	Executables for IRIX 5.x.

  xemacs-19.11-rs6000-ibm-aix3.2.tar.gz
	Executables for AIX 3.2.4 and 3.2.5.

	get the latest version of this from any of the GNU mirror sites.

Don't forget to set "binary" mode when transferring these files.  Unpack them
with some variation of the command "zcat xemacs-19.11.tar.gz | tar -pvxf -".


There is a new mailing list for discussing XEmacs.

   xem...@cs.uiuc.edu:	    For reporting all bugs in XEmacs, including bugs
			    in the compilation and installation procedures.
			    Also for random questions and conversation about
			    using XEmacs.

To be added or removed from this mailing list, send mail to
xemacs-...@cs.uiuc.edu.  (Send all administrative requests, and only
administrative requests, to this address.)

A CFV (Call For Votes) is currently in progress for a new newsgroup
comp.emacs.xemacs.  After this group passes and is created the xemacs mailing
list will be bidirectionally gatewayed into it.  In the meantime, xemacs is
simply an alias for help-xemacs.


The old mailing lists are still active for now, but have been renamed.

   bug-luc...@lucid.com is now:

   bug-x...@cs.uiuc.edu	For reporting all bugs in XEmacs,
				including bugs in the compilation and
				installation procedures.


   help-luc...@lucid.com is now:

   help-...@cs.uiuc.edu	For random questions and conversation
				about using XEmacs.


To be added or removed from these mailing lists, send mail to
bug-xemac...@cs.uiuc.edu, help-xema...@cs.uiuc.edu or
xemacs-...@cs.uiuc.edu).  (Send all administrative requests, and
only administrative requests, to these addresses.)  These mailing
lists are bidirectionally gatewayed into the newsgroups
alt.lucid-emacs.bug and alt.lucid-emacs.help.

Please use the newsgroups instead of the mailing lists if at all possible; it
makes less work for us.

Do not send messages about problems with XEmacs to the FSF GNU Emacs
newsgroups and mailing lists (help-gn...@prep.ai.mit.edu,
bug-gn...@prep.ai.mit.edu, gnu.emacs.help, gnu.emacs.bug, et cetera)
unless you are sure that the problem you are reporting is a problem with both
versions of Emacs.

For information about the differences between XEmacs and FSF GNU
Emacs, see the NEWS file included with the XEmacs distribution or
check the XEmacs WWW page.


** Major Differences Between 19.10 and 19.11
============================================
  
The name has changed from "Lucid Emacs" to "XEmacs".  Along with this is a
new canonical ftp site: cs.uiuc.edu:/pub/xemacs.

XEmacs now has its very own World Wide Web page!  It contains a
complete list of the FTP distribution sites, the most recent FAQ,
pointers to elisp packages not included with the distribution, and
other useful stuff.  Check it out at http://xemacs.cs.uiuc.edu/.

A preliminary New Users Guide.

cc-mode.el now provides the default C and C++ modes.

The primary goal of this release is stability.  Very few new features have
been introduced but lots of bugs have been fixed.  Many of the elisp packages
have been updated.

Some of the new elisp packages ---

tcl-mode.el:  major mode for editing TCL code

fast-lock.el: saves and restores font-lock highlighting, greatly
            reducing the time necessary for loading a font-lock'ed
            file

ps-print.el: prints buffers to Postscript printers preserving the
           buffer's bold and italic text attributes

toolbar.el: provides a "fake" toolbar for use with XEmacs (an
          integrated one will be included with 19.12)
