I  too  have  an EMACS which runs on VAXes under 4.1BSD.  It differs from
Gosling's EMACS in that the user interface is virtually identical to that
of  Twenex  EMACS;  almost  all  of the standard EMACS commands have been
implemented, and in most cases they work exactly the same as  on  Twenex.
It  has  such  features  as real control-meta commands, region filtering,
text justifying, crash recovery, automatic  backup  file  creation,  Lisp
mode commands for manipulating s-expressions, lists, and defuns, keyboard
macros, a tutorial, and  all  the  standard  EMACS  online  documentation
except  the  INFO  subsystem,  which  will  be  coming later.  It doesn't
currently have a macro language, but I am about to add one; it will  look
much like the meta-Lisp in Gosling's EMACS.
