There are several.  If you have a VAX, probably the editor of choice is
one written by James Gosling @ CMU-10A.  Contact him for details
(gosling@cmua).  On an 11, the problem is more difficult.  There a couple
around, but at least one of them is an "unreleased" Bell Labs program.
They all have some lossages.
