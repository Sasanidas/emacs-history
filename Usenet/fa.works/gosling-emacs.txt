There are (at least) two editors entitled EMACS on the Berkeley
VM/UNIX VAX system.  The one by James Gosling of CMU seems to
be favored.  It has a LISP-like language for extension.  It is
missing features of various sorts, however.

  A point of information: There exists an excellent, if not fully
mature, EMACS for the VAX running Berkeley UNIX or VMS+EUNICE.
  The basic editing level is written entirely in C (zero lines of
machine code), the macro level is an embedded lisp-like language
called MLISP (which is INFINITELY more comprehensable than TECO
macros!), and the top level is the usual EMACS
double-bucky-coke-bottle command language.
  Inquiries sould go to GOSLING@CMUA, but I think he is on summer
vacation or some such.
