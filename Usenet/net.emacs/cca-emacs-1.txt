A new version of EMACS has now been released by CCA.  A number of
important new features have been added since the last release, including
word abbreviation mode, visible marks, and the ability to run shells
inside buffers.  Starting with this version, the following new
distribution policy applies:

A CCA EMACS licence is now available for $850 ($350 for educational
institutions).  The license is valid for a single CPU; quantity
discounts are available.  Those sites interested in purchasing a license
should send me their name and address, and I will send them a pair of
license forms to be filled out.  Upon receipt of two completed forms
plus the appropriate fee, CCA will execute the license and send one
completed form to the applicant, along with a tape containing CCA EMACS
(including sources), a complete manual, and command charts.

Major updates of CCA EMACS are available to license holders for $300.
Until March 15th, current users of CCA EMACS who do not hold licenses
may also get the latest release for $300.  After March 15th, the rates
quoted in the previous paragraph apply to everyone.

License forms may be obtained by contacting me through uucpnet at
decvax!cca!z, or through the U.S. mail at the following address:
