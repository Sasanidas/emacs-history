	The GNU project has released its first major subsystem,
	the EMACS editor. This editor is a sophisticated screen
	editor that is compatible and comparable with the EMACS
	editors being sold by UniPress and CCA. It comes with
	Mock Lisp ( did you know that UniPress trademarked MLISP??),
	and all the little bells and features most of us expect
	with EMACS.

	The GNU version of EMACS, written by Richard Stallman, is
	available for distribution. The distribution includes all
	source code for EMACS and a source code level debugger.
	Furthermore, under the GNU project banner, the EMACS system
	can be distributed (in source code form) by one and all.

	I was thinking of sending out the source code over the net,
	but resisted : it is over 1Mbyte of code. If there is
	enough demand, I will add a UUCP dial-in to our system, or
	send out tapes, or ... ?

	Is anyone interested in EMACS? If so, please tell me how
	you think I should distribute it?
