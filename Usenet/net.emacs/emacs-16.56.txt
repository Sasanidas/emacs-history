GNU Emacs 16.56 is a completely Gosling-free version with lots of
improvements.  It is also smaller than version 15.34.  Some toleration
of flow control is provided.  It is in /u2/emacs/edist.tar on mit-prep;
also individual files in /u2/emacs/dist.

READ THE NEWS FILE before you use it.  Also read INSTALL; the procedures
have been simplified.

Tex source for the manual is included.

diffs from version 15.34 may be made available on prep in a few days;
but the manual source may make that sort of useless.

mly will be fixing bugs for the next few weeks while I am away.
Mail orders for tapes will be covered too.
