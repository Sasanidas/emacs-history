A couple more bugs have been found in 16.57/58.

1) In abbrev.c, there are two calls to Fdefine_abbrev
that pass only four arguments.  They should pass a fifth
argument:   make_number (0)

2) In buffer.c, there is a call to Fnext_window that passes
only one argument.  Qnil should be passed as a second argument.

3) In regex.c, in the function re_match_2, the code following
 case endline: should look like
	  if (d == end2
	      || (d == end1 ? (size2 == 0 || *string2 == '\n') : *d == '\n'))
	    break;
	  goto fail;

These are all incorporated in 16.59, available in a few minutes.
