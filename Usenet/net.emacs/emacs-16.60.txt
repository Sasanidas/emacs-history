I have fixed two more bugs, making Emacs 16.60:
A file diff-16.56-16.60 is available on /u2/emacs

in process.c:
***************
*** 38,43
  #include "window.h"
  #include "buffer.h"
  #include "process.h"
  
  extern errno;
  extern sys_nerr;

--- 38,47 -----
  #include "window.h"
  #include "buffer.h"
  #include "process.h"
+   
+ #ifdef howmany				/* in sys/types.h under 4.3 BSD */
+ #undef howmany
+ #endif
  
  extern errno;
  extern sys_nerr;


in dispnew.c:
***************

    register int i;
  
    int free_at_end_vpos = screen_height;
-   if (scroll_region_ok)
-     free_at_end_vpos -= unchanged_at_bottom;
-   else if (memory_below_screen)
-     free_at_end_vpos = -1;
    
    /* Compute hash codes of all the lines.
       Also calculate number of changed lines,
