Emacs 17.36 is now available for general distribution.
It is in /u2/emacs/edist.tar-17.36 and as individual files
in /u2/emacs/dist, on Internet host prep.ai.mit.edu.

The current manual source, included in the distribution, can be
formatted with an ordinary TeX.  The manual in dvi format is available
as /u2/emacs/emacs.dvi.

Differences from 17.35 are in /u2/emacs/diff-17.35-17.36 (directories
src, lisp and etc only).  However, it is a good idea to get the entire
current distriution so as to have up-to-date manual files, etc.
Any further changes will be bug fixes and will be posted to this list,
so if you do this now you will not have to do it again.

The Free Software Foundation will start distributing Emacs version
17 (tapes and printed manuals) in a couple of weeks.
