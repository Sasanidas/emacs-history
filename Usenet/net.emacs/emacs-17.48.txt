You can now get Emacs 17.48, from the directory /u2/emacs/dist
or the tar file /u2/emacs/edist.tar-17.48.  Difference files
are available for upgrading from versions 17.43, 17.45, 17.46 and 17.47.
They are called /u2/emacs/diff-17.*-17.48.  All are on this host
(prep.ai.mit.edu) and available for anonymous ftp.

The Free Software Foundation will now begin shipping Emacs 17 tapes.
To order a tape, send $150 (Mass residents add 5%, overseas add
$15 if you want air mail) to

  Free Software Foundation
  1000 Mass Ave
  Cambridge, MA 02138

The tapes will also contain bison (a yacc replacement),
MIT Scheme and hack (a rogue-like game).

Emacs manuals are available too, at $15 a copy (plus $15 more for
air mail if overseas).  The manual sources are part of the Emacs
distribution; the output from TeX is in /u2/emacs/emacs.dvi.
