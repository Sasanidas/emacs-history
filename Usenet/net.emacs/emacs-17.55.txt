GNU Emacs 17.55 is now available in the usual place:
/u2/emacs/edist.tar-17.52 on prep.ai.mit.edu.
Differences from 17.54 are available now;
differences from 17.49 will appear later tonight in
/u2/emacs/diff-17.49-17.55

This new version is known to work on system V rel 0 and 2
on vaxes, and system V rel 2 on the NCR Tower 32.
It probably fixes the problems some people have recently
reported seeing.

I urge everyone to upgrade their earlier subversions of
Emacs version 17 to 17.55, since this is nearly final
and future changes will be very small.

Tapes of this version will start to be available from
the Free Software Foundation next week.  In addition,
these tapes will have MIT Scheme version 4.0, which has
been changed to be nearly compatible with the Revised
Revised Report on Scheme, which is included in the
distribution in machine-readable form.

For more information on ordering tapes, send me mail.
