Emacs version 17.63 is now available.  Differences from
versions 17.60, 17.61 and 17.62 are in /u2/emacs/diff-...
on prep.ai.mit.edu.  These files range in size from
20k to 35k.  Perhaps someone would like to post them to
an appropriate list; I am not sure whether it is good
to post such large files to this list, so I will let others decide.
