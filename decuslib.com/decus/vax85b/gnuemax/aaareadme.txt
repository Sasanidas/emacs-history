	GNU EMACS

This directory tree contains sources to a version of R. Stallman's
GNU EMACS editor, a full powered version of EMACS. It currently
runs on Unix (which GNU will look like to applications programs)
and has had filenames somewhat regularized to go into VMS V3.X.
	It is here in the hope someone will convert it to VMS
so we'll all have a better EMACS than the Gosling version, which
Unix sites seem to find inferior to this one. There are a couple
of subset-EMACS editors here too for the amusement of whoever wants
to try them. The TARDIR.LIS file contains the original pathnames
of the Unix versions and TARFIL.LST is the files, in the same order,
as written to a VMS directory tree.
