GNU EMACS

This is a VERY preliminary release of GNU EMACS for VMS. It is a full
EMACS dialect (at least in design) with a real-LISP internal control
language (i.e., not a mock-LISP). Full sources are here but this version
is somewhat dated and Marty Sasaki, Harvard, is working on a much nicer
and less buggy one. This is here for you hackers who may want to help
with it.
