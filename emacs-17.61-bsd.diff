-	* CHANGES IN THE EMACS DIRECTORY FOR THE 4.3BSD DISTRIBUTION
-	____________________________________________________________
-
-	* src/config.h, src/paths.h:
-	Provide sample versions of these files (see INSTALL for details).
-	These should work on VAXen with vanilla directories.  For other
-	CPU's, you'll have to change config.h; if you've moved directories
-	around, change paths.h.  If you are running the X window system,
-	change ``#undef HAVE_X_WINDOWS'' to ``#define HAVE_X_WINDOWS''
-	in config.h.
-
-	* lisp/mh-e.el (MH mail-handler front end):
-	Replace with latest version (3.3) by ucbvax!larus.  This
-	version incorporates some fixes/improvements that are not
-	yet in the FSF distribution (as of the date above).
-	Share and enjoy.
-
-	* etc/emacs.1 (troff'able man page):
-	Change pathnames in FILES section to reflect where they are
-	in this distribution.
-
-	* INSTALL (installation guide):
-	Say in LOSSAGES section to disregard `BSD redefined' and
-	`BSD4_3 redefined' warning messages.
-
-	* build-install (shell script to build and install emacs):
-	Rearrange the installation part somewhat, since 4.3 systems
-	typically have sources living in a different places from libraries.
-	(Here at Berkeley, sources are all maintained on one machine
-	and libraries are distributed to other machines over a local network;
-	the script is now set up for this kind of environment).
-
-	* README (note to installer):
-	Insert pointer to this file.
-
-	* dbx and cpp are not included on the distribution.

 LOSSAGES
 Known possible problems building and running GNU Emacs
 
-* In the 4.3bsd distribution, you will get some spurious warning messages
-saying `BSD redefined' or `BSD4_3 redefined' from the C compiler while
-building Emacs.  These are due to a last minute surprise in the 4.3
-header files which we did not have time to correct for.  For now,
-please disregard the messages.

 * Watch out for .emacs files and EMACSLOADPATH environment vars
 
 These control the actions of Emacs.
