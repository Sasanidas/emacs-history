HyperActiveFTP Installation Menu     <(Return to HyperActiveFTP dired)>
--------------------------------     

NOTE: 	Those who have had previous versions of HyperActiveFTP just do
	steps 0, 1 and 2 to update their system.

-*-	0 
	
Everyone must <(Load in the Installation Code)>. Even if you have this file 
locally, click this button as I update the Installation Code off and on.

-*-	1 

1.1 
HyperActiveFTP should be installed in its own directory. If you want
to use the default installation directory, proceed to 1.4. If you want
to change the default directory, follow the directions in 1.2-1.4 carefully.

1.2
It should not be installed in or below the Hyperbole directory because it
will be tedious for you to separate the HyperActiveFTP files from the 
Hyperbole files when a new distribution of Hyperbole comes out.

1.3 
It is suggested that you place the directory for HyperActiveFTP just below 
the directory where you keep all of your emacs lisp code. For example, if 
all of your emacs lisp code is in ~/gnu, then when prompted for the 
HyperActive directory name, enter ~/gnu/HyperActive/. DO NOT FORGET
THE SLASH.	

1.4 
The default installation directory is ~/emacs/active-hyper/
Click here if you want to <(Change Default Installation Directory)>
or click here to <(Make Hyper-Installation Directory)>

-*-	2

IF	
you already have a previous version of HyperActiveFTP
then click here and I will just install <(updated files)>

ELSE
We will copy all the files from the home site at
archive.cis.ohio-state.edu into the Hyper-Installation Directory. 
To overwrite old files in the Hyper-Installation Directory or to get
your very first distribution of HyperActiveFTP, click here and I will
<(Install the Latest Version of HyperActiveFTP)>

-*-	3

ASSUMING you have these two commands in your .emacs file:

(require 'ange-ftp)
(load "hsite")

Click here to <(find-file ~/.emacs)> and then add the following line
anywhere in the file:

(load-file "~/emacs/active-hyper/active-hyper.requirements.el")

-*-	4
Now re-evaluate the .emacs file.
And save it.

-*-	5
Type M-x active-hyper:get-hyper to bring up the main menu.
