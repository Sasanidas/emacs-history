looking at that node, which is (dir)Top.

File: dir	Node: Top	This is the top of the INFO tree
  This (the Directory node) gives a menu of major topics. 
  Typing "d" returns here, "q" exits, "?" lists all INFO commands, "h" 
  gives a primer for first-timers, "mTexinfo<Return>" visits Texinfo topic,
  etc.
  --- PLEASE ADD DOCUMENTATION TO THIS TREE. (See INFO topic first.) ---
