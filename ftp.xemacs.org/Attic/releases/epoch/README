Epoch and XEmacs (formerly Lucid Emacs) are in the process of merging.
The latest release of XEmacs (19.11) is now using the Epoch redisplay
engine.  Additional functionality only available in Epoch will be
merged into XEmacs over the next several months.

For additional future information on the merger, watch the newsgroup
alt.lucid-emacs.help.  If you are using XEmacs, please report bugs to
alt.lucid-emacs.bug.  Support for Epoch proper has been dropped.  All
efforts are going towards merging Epoch functionality into XEmacs.

The current version of XEmacs is located in the directoyr /pub/xemacs.
The last Epoch release, 4.2, is in /pub/epoch-files/epoch.
