Fri Jun 14 20:12:32 1985  K. Shane Hartman  (shane at mit-prep)

	* loaddefs.el (rmail-dont-reply-to-names):
	Misleading documentation said `list' of names.  Its really a
	regular expression.  Make it nil by default.  Also, add defconst
	for `rmail-spool-directory'.

	* mail-utils.el (rmail-dont-reply-to):
	Check for nilness of rmail-dont-reply-to-names and skip strip
	loop if so.

	* loaddefs.el: Elisp -> Emacs-Lisp.

	* echistory.el, chistory.el: Elisp -> Emacs-Lisp.

	* rmail.el:
	Various functions - If message counters aren't set, set them.
	Expunge unsets them.  Make expunge give running count in
	minibuffer messages.

Fri Jun 14 19:19:30 1985  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at mit-prep)

	* lisp-mode.el, startup.el, loadup.el:

Fri Jun 14 05:40:11 1985  K. Shane Hartman  (shane at mit-prep)

	* rmail.el (rmail-mode-1):
	Use %b instead of %17b in mode-line-format to leave more room for
	attributes (some of us like time in the modeline).

	* rmail.el:
	Make rmail-summary-goto-msg barf if the summary is invalid (e.g.
	after `e' or `g') and tell user to make a new one, leaving them in
	the rmail window which is right place to do it.

	* rmail.el:
	Add commands for user to set attributes.  rlk called these
	keywords and duplicated code (the only `attributes' were
	"deleted" and "answered").  I don't think the distinction is worth
	it.  Add command for summarizing by attribute.  Make
	`rmail-new-summary' support it.

	* rmail.el (rmail-show-message): search instead of re-search.

	* rmail.el (rmail-output-to-mail-file): Yechh.  Cleaned it up.

	* rmail.el (rmail-summary-mode):
	Add functions for scrolling current message from summary.  After
	rlk, only make them bullet proof.  Add quit from rmail.

	* rmail.el (rmail-new-summary):
	Reuse old summary buffers when possible.  After rlk, only his way
	of doing it was brain damaged.

	* rmail.el:
	rmail-last-message was off by 1.  Fix it and put it on key `>'.
	(bug noted by rlk).  Make rmail-edit run text-mode-hook.  rlk also
	had it run `rmail-edit-mode-hook' but this is silly because function
	claims to be like text-mode except for two keys.

	* rmail.el (rmail-insert-inbox-text):
	Chomper wasn't deleting ~/.newmail after moving mail from
	/usr/spool/mail/.  Make it do the right thing.  Use new variable
	rmail-spool-directory (default "/usr/spool/mail/") to determine
	if movemail should be called (some people use "/spool/mail/").
	Probably should move defvar to loaddefs when released.

	* simple.el: Flush `blink-matching-paren-ding' and code.

	* add-log.el: Flush `add-log-entry-to-log-in-buffer'.

	* loaddefs.el:
	Changes to reflect partitioning of command history stuff. 
	Flush autoload of report-emacs-bug, leave the file emacsbug.el for
	arpanet sites to use if they want.
	
	* echistory.el: (require 'chistory)

	* chistory.el:
	Move list-command-history and command-history-mode here.  Purpose
	of this file is just to look at the history.  Also contains
	unrelated (to listing) but useful `repeat-matching-complex-command'.

	* simple.el (repeat-complex-command):
	Replaced its definition with `repeat-edit-nth-complex-command' from
	chistory.el, edit form in minibuffer instead of asking for
	confirmation.  Add new function `edit-and-eval-command' which it
	uses.

Thu Jun 13 01:30:08 1985  K. Shane Hartman  (shane at mit-prep)

	* rmail.el (rmail-insert-inbox-text):
	Expand file name "movemail" in exec-directory for call-process.
	The only reason it worked here before is because exec-directory is
	in most people's shell paths.
	No, this directory is added automatically to the path
	used by call-process.  It should have worked before. - RMS

	* loaddefs.el:  C-z -> C-c in documentation for mail.
	autoload report-emacs-bug from emacsbug.el.

	* emacsbug.el:  New file.  Reports bugs with version info.

	* helper.el (Helper-describe-bindings):
	Make it describe local bindings faster by binding global map to
	nil so describe-bindings is faked out.

	* lisp-mode.el: First form of prog1 is distinguished.

	* loaddefs.el: autoload functions from chistory.el and echistory.el.

	* chistory.el:
	New file containing two alternatives to `repeat-complex-command'
	which put the form in the minibuffer instead of asking for
	confirmation.

	* echistory.el:
	Finished it.  Split off two useful but unrelated commands into
	chistory.el.  Made command-history-mode unable to redo expressions
	because there is no sensible way to pick buffer to do it in: now
	its just for looking at the history produced by
	list-command-history or after electric-command-history throws.

	* electric.el: Allow specification of prompt to
	Electric-command-loop.  Interpret nil max-height argument to
	Electric-pop-up-window as license to grab as much of the screen as
	necessary if buffer wont fit; also fix fencepost neglect to
	account for modeline in height computations.

Wed Jun 12 21:22:32 1985  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at mit-prep)

	* rmail (rmail-insert-inbox-text)
	file-name-directory includes a trailing "/"

Wed Jun 12 01:23:28 1985  K. Shane Hartman  (shane at mit-prep)

	* shell.el (inferior-lisp-mode):
	Call lisp-mode-hook AFTER shell-mode-hook.

	* rmail.el (rmail-get-attribute-string):
	Did not account for empty attribute string.  Neglected to include
	leading `,' for rmail-display-message-attributes.  Unbound
	variable dot-max-save - I guessed that it was really supposed to
	be dot-min before the widen (the start of the user visible header)
	so I bound it and renamed it dot-min-save.

	* ebuff-menu.el:
	New variable  after-electric-buffer-menu  called after select if
	non-nil.  Bind goal-column to nil while running.

	* add-log.el:
	New function  add-log-entry-to-log-in-buffer.  Use when adding
	multiple entries to the ChangeLog.  Bound to ESC-*.  Made it share
	code with add-change-log-entry (former calls latter).

Wed Jun 12 00:24:07 1985  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at mit-prep)

	* rmail.el (rmail-get-attribute-string):
	Rewritten by rlk to be smaller and more general.

Tue Jun 11 18:29:07 1985  K. Shane Hartman  (shane at mit-prep)

	* ebuff-menu.el:  Make M-C-v scroll-other-window instead of
	scroll-down.  Make M-v scroll-down.  

	* ebuff-menu.el, echistory.el:	Made them use electric.

	* electric.el:
	New module for packages that retain control until some event
	occurs.  Command loop and window maker.

Mon Jun 10 21:07:50 1985  K. Shane Hartman  (shane at mit-prep)

	* echistory.el:
	Made it use helper.el.  Remove kill-ring-save stuff pending use of
	new winning prin1-to-string for minibuffer hacking.

	* view.el:  Made it use helper.el.

	* helper.el:
	New module for packages which want to do help without giving up
	control. 

Mon Jun 10 16:46:02 1985  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at mit-prep)

	* sendmail.el:
	Switch to C-c as prefix instead of C-z.

Sun Jun  9 20:20:30 1985  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at mit-prep)

	* simple.el:
	Rename kill-ring-save to copy-region-as-kill.
	Old name still works.

	* tags.el (visit-tag-table-buffer):
	Give error unless tag table starts with a formfeed
	as it should.

	* sendmail.el:
	Install C-z w as mail-signature.
	Fix bug of reinserting --text...-- in wrong place
	when a null subject was deleted.

	* macros.el (kbd-macro-query):
	Don't ask for input when macro is being defined.
	When macro is executing, make prompt really appear.
	In loaddefs, put this on C-x q.

Sun Jun  9 03:33:18 1985  K. Shane Hartman  (shane at mit-prep)

	* dired.el:
	Fix bugs in dired introduced by use of auto-save-file-name-p.  Dont
	call it if it isn't fbound (just look for `#').  Add second arg to
	dired-get-filename which says just return nil (no error) if there
	is no filename on line.  Rename dired-mark-backup-and-temp-files
	to be dired-mark-backup-and-auto-save-files.

Sat Jun  8 00:41:17 1985  K. Shane Hartman  (shane at mit-prep)

	* ebuff-menu.el (electric-buffer-list):
	Lost if # lines < window-min-height and there was only one window.
	Make it win!

	* echistory.el:
	New file - implements command history interface (electric and
	plain jane listing).  Waiting for opinions before I put it in
	loaddefs.

	* ebuff-menu.el (electric-buffer-list):
	Went to char select after Buffer-menu-execute, which can kill
	lines.  So set mark at select before execute and go to mark before
	select.  Winnage.
		
	* buff-menu.el:
	Stomp all kinds of roaches.  Buffer-menu-do-kills was doing re-search
	when it wanted to do search (no harm, but faster).  Fix fencepost
	error, when it killed a buffer line, it neglected to move back,
	thereby sitting on potential `K' which was missed. Wrap
	save-excursion around kill-buffer, it seems that kill-buffer changes
	something when it asks about mod file (dont ask me ...).
	Buffer-menu-do-saves was searching for "\n.S", it meant re-search.
	Teach Buffer-menu-unmark how to handle `%' and `*' at same time.

	* files.el (find-file-no-select):
	Don't run dired if value of new variable  find-file-run-dired  is
	nil.  t by default.

Fri Jun  7 05:21:08 1985  K. Shane Hartman  (shane at mit-prep)

	* options.el (list-options): Use substitute-command-keys.

	* loaddefs.el (view-file, view-buffer, electric-buffer-list):
	Mention view-hook.  Mention electric-buffer-menu-mode-hook.

	* ebuff-menu.el:
	Restrict dot to actual buffer description line.  Document some
	functions.  Make electric-buffer-menu-describe-mode interactive.
	Make C-g shutup when it exits, advertise it as exit char.
	Restrict help so that window configuration lossage is impossible
	(could lose if went into full blown help).  Add function for
	describing help options.  Add `v' command for viewing buffer and
	returning to the Electric Buffer List.

	* loaddefs.el: autoload edit-picture.

	* picture.el: New "Major" mode for editing pictures and tables.

	* view.el:
	Fix bug with non-file-buffer names.  Use buffer name instead in
	these cases.  New variable view-hook.

Thu Jun  6 15:04:15 1985  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at mit-prep)

	* view.el:
	(provide 'view)
	defined unadvertized c-m-a, c-m-e, c-m-b, c-m-f

Thu Jun  6 07:39:17 1985  K. Shane Hartman  (shane at mit-prep)

	* view.el:
	Restrict quit to q, C-c, C-z.  Fill keymaps with new function
	view-undefined which dings and tells you how to quit or get help.

	* indent.el (edit-tab-stops-note-changes):
	Make *Tab Stops* buffer go away when changes are installed by
	switching to edit-tab-stops-buffer and burying *Tab Stops*.

	* fill.el:
	New function fill-individual-paragraphs.

	* dired.el:

	and make it use auto-save-file-name-p.

	* bytecode.el (byte-recompile-directory):
	Use auto-save-file-name-p.  Provide default definition of same.

	* files.el:
	Define auto-save-file-name-p.

Tue Jun  4 16:59:03 1985  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at mit-prep)

	* sendmail.el (sendmail-send-it):
	Somewhat gratuitously deleting empty subject lines.
	/usr/lib/sendmail seems smart enough (!) to hack this itself

Tue Jun  4 00:42:12 1985  K. Shane Hartman  (shane at mit-prep)

	* info.el (Info-find-node, Info-exit):
	Use expansion of filename in error message on file not found in
	Info-find-node.  Bury the current buffer in Info-exit because you
	can say C-h i if you want to look at it again.

	* simple.el (goal-column):
	Use \\[...] to refer to set-goal-column in variable documentation.

	* simple.el (function-called-at-dot, variable-at-dot):
	Eliminate redundant testing of nil'ness of obj in and clauses.

	* simple.el (describe-variable):
	Bind enable-recursive-minibuffers so can use C-h v.  It would be
	nice if instead could enable JUST C-h v (or C-h f for
	describe-function).
		
	* aton.el (occur-menu):
	Bogus message in minibuffer claimed C-z expanded menu entry.
	Use substitute-command-keys to get the right key.  Move to the
	first line if rebuild-summary, else the next line.  Make the
	occur menu buffer read-only.

Mon Jun  3 22:12:27 1985  K. Shane Hartman  (shane at mit-prep)

	* mim-mode.el:
	Fix bugs related to moving across atoms in other packages (i.e.
	with trailers).

Mon Jun  3 18:01:33 1985  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at mit-prep)

	* c-mode.el (indent-c-exp, calculate-c-indent):
	Fix indentation of line following a #-directive in C-M-Q,
	by doing essentially what calculate-c-indent does.
	New subroutine c-backward-to-start-of-if.

	* isearch.el:
	Don't allow reverse search to match a string straddling the
	initial value of dot.

	* loaddefs.el:  Update documentation for rmail.

	* lisp-mode.el (calculate-lisp-indent):
	Asked (fboundp 'lisp-indent-hook).  Right question is boundp.

	* scheme-mode.el (calculate-scheme-indent): Ditto.
	
	* compile.el (next-error): Missed a \\[...].

	* buff-menu.el:
	Use \\[...].  Disambiguate documentation of q command (read as if
	you marked buffers with > instead of m, now mention mark `>' and
	what command you use to make one).

	* loaddefs.el:
	Put \ in front of \[ where needed.  ' next-error in autoload
	definition.  Fix typo in electric-buffer-list documentation (also fix
	in ebuff-menu).

Sat Jun  1 04:51:31 1985  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at mit-prep)

	* c-mode.el (c-backward-to-noncomment):
	Still failed to terminate in some cases (after many #include's and
	#defines, comments at beginning of file).  Now stop if looking at #

	Make it interactive since it's on a key.  Also, indent lambda like
	defun. 

	* view.el:
	Improve documentation.  Add isearch, previous and next
	line (useful in conjunction with recenter and argument).  Flush
	repeat last command because it really does not repeat all commands.

	* rmail.el:
	Add C-r command (rmail-edit-current-message) and its commands.
	Separated out part of rmail-mode as rmail-mode-1.

	new-version-level.el => grow-vers.el.
	scheme-mode.el => scheme.el
	compare-windows.el => compare-w.el
	electric-buffer-list.el => ebuff-menu.el

Tue May 28 10:55:20 1985  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at mit-prep)

	* simple.el (describe-function)
	bind enable-recursive-minibuffers to read fn name
	(useful when typing c-h f after m-esc)

	at beginning of buffer.  Make it stop if it sees bobp in such cases.

	was searching for "\n^L" not "\n\^L"

	* lisp-mode.el, loadup.el, startup.el
	renamed lisp-interaction-mode to elisp-interaction-mode
	Made elisp-mode call elisp-mode-hook, elisp-interaction-mode call
	elisp-interaction-mode-hook.  This will break people's init files!

	* loaddefs.el
	made ".lisp" suffixes get lisp mode.  Toto, I don't think we're
	using fourteen-character filenames anymore.
	Autoload scheme-mode

	* scheme-mode.el
	installed scheme-mode, courtesy MIT scheme people.

	* lisp-mode.el
	made mode doc strings use \[...] substitute-command-keys technology

Thu May 23 02:17:56 1985  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at mit-prep)

	* lisp-mode.el:
	Renamed lisp-mode to elisp-mode and external-lisp-mode to lisp-mode.

Wed May 22 05:56:46 1985  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at mit-prep)

	* nrnews.el
	Foo.  A distinct lack of communication here.
	Fairly radical surgery --- many bug fixes and clarifications,
	quite different from rnews.el  Sigh

Wed May 22 05:01:47 1985  K. Shane Hartman  (shane at mit-prep)

	* view.el
	Add new flavor of help.  ?, h still give list of
	commands.  C-h understands m, c, k options.  Make
	help commands use pop up window with scroll on space.

	* loaddefs.el
	Minor change for documentation of view-file and
	view-buffer because C-h does not describe mode now.

Wed May 22 01:21:24 1985  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at mit-prep)

	  Don't print any messages.
	news-previous-group: call news-next-group.
	  Don't print any messages.
	news-move-to-message: simplify by using news-previous-group.
	  Also, most messages were spurious.
	news-goto-news-group: it had duplicate definitions.
	  Flushed both of them; use news-go-to-news-group instead.
	various: standardized elipses in messages.
	  Use error rather than message where appropriate.

Tue May 21 06:42:12 1985  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at mit-prep)

	* mlsupport:
	Fixs assorted typos where variable "bufname" was changed to "name"

	* view.el
	Make M-<, M-> work.  Fix documentation strings to work with the
	combination of lisp quoting and substitute-command-keys quoting.

	* electric-buffer-list.el
	Call Buffer-menu-execute before selecting. (Why doesn't standard
	buffer-menu-mode do this?)  Flush "x", "1" and "2" commands

	* buff-menu.el:
	Call bury-buffer after selecting new buffer.
	Make things work when  pop-up-windows  is nil.

Tue May 21 05:40:18 1985  K. Shane Hartman  (shane at mit-prep)

	Flush skip commands since they dont make much sense.  Make searches,
	goto-line's center display at point found with dot at beginning of
	line.  Use mark ring and provide mark manipulation commands.  C-l

Tue May 21 01:07:52 1985  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at mit-prep)

	* loadup.el:
	Copy DOCSTR rather than renaming it.

	* sendmail.el (mail-yank-original):

	Bury the *mail* buffer.

Sun May 19 16:05:08 1985  Richard Mlynarik  (mly at mit-prep)

	* view.el, dired.el
	typos in viewing stuff

	* simple.el, isearch.el
	Added prompt argument to read-quoted-char; improved isearch
	input echoing when reading quoted char.

	* sendmail.el, loaddefs.el
	added send-mail-function; initially sendmail-send-it
	(also, mail-yank-ignored-headers had a typo)

	* rmail.el (rmail-get-new-mail, convert-to-babyl-format, ...)
	  loaddefs.el
	Remodularize inbox parsing.  Add support(?) for mmdf inboxes.

	what this format is; however the code installed seems to work
	for all cases encountered

Sun May 19 15:36:12 1985  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at mit-prep)

	* rmail.el (rmail-get-new-mail):

Sat May 18 11:30:36 1985  K. Shane Hartman  (shane at mit-prep)

	* view.el, more-mode.el: Latter flushed in favor of former.
	view-mode preserves concept of more-mode but uses
	non-standard command loop so that viewed buffer is unchanged
	on exit from mode.

	* dired.el, loaddefs.el: Changed to use view.el.  Change
	documentation of dired-listing-switches to note importance of
	excluding 'F' option.

Fri May 17 01:25:31 1985  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at mit-prep)

	* simple.el: make <help> i run info

	* sundry changes to go with changes in src/fileio.c making
	copy-file, rename-file, add-name take an optional third argument.
	The only autoloaded system code this breaks is rmail ---
	a condition-case for wrong-number-of-arguments kludge was installed
	there in two places to make things work until everybody is running
	an emacs which takes the extra arg (marked "** KLUDGE **".) Remember
	to remove the kludge at that time!
	Mods to files.el, loadup.el, rmail.el

	* added autoloading function electic-buffer-list

	* buff-menu.el: make splitting screen between > 2 buffers work

Thu May 16 03:23:38 1985  K. Shane Hartman  (shane at mit-prep)

	* dired.el: Put dired-rename-file, dired-copy file-on keys.  Make
	them change buffer if appropriate.  Put	dired-mark-backup-files,
	dired-mark-temp-files on keys.  Eliminate possibility of looping
	at last line in dired-repeat-over-filenames.

Wed May 15 00:47:03 1985  K. Shane Hartman (shane at mit-grape-nehi)

	* dired.el: Fix bug in dired-noselect which caused dired of / to
	get buffer name of /default/directory// with contents of /.

Mon May 13 18:58:03 1985  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at mit-prep)

	replace loop so that replacing continues after moving back to
	previous. 

	* add-log.el: add prefix arg to add-change-log-entry so will
	prompt for information if desired.  If there is an entry for today,
	make sure login-name is same before using it, else make new entry.
	Use auto-fill-mode.

Sun May 12 17:00:00 1985  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at mit-prep)

	* lisp-mode.el: defined lisp-mode-commands, lisp-mode-variables.
	Added external-lisp-mode.
	Made doc strings mention mode hook variables.

	* shell.el: defined functions `lisp' and `inferior-lisp-mode'.
	Renamed shell-send-defun... to lisp-send-defun...

Sun May 12 04:01:21 1985  Shane  (shane at mit-ajax)
	simple.el: suppress matching close paren if preceded
		by char syntax \.
	mim-mode.el: flush private paren blinker in favor of default.
	add-log.el: change mode-string to mode-name so reflected in
		mode-line.  change \\W to \\sW when looking for place to add.

Sun May 12 04:01:21 1985  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at mit-prep)
	simple.el: modified open-line to insert newlines before
		an existing one before dot.  This makes better redisplay.
	dired.el: Installed Shane's changes that allow user to choose
		switches to use.

Sat May 11 16:23:19 1985  Richard M. Stallman  (rms at mit-prep)

		correctly displays one message of that file
		but does not try to get new mail.
