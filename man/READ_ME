This directory contains the Tex sources of the Emacs manual,
plus a macro package (botex) necessary for processing it.

To generate the manual, you need a version of tex which has been
built to accept control characters as input.  There is a comment
in tex.web telling you exactly what to do to make this work.

1) Run tex on emacs.tex, producing emacs.cp, emacs.cf, emacs.kw,
and emacs.vr (unsorted index files), plus emacs.aux (cross ref file).

2) Compile texindex.c, and run it:
   `texindex emacs.cp emacs.cf emacs.vr emacs.kw'
This produces sorted index files emacs.cps, emacs.cfs, etc.
that are used as input in step 3.

3) Run tex on emacs.tex again.

4) Now you have a dvi file that you can print.

The latest versions of all the intermediate files are supplied,
so if you want to print the manual with no change, you can start with
step 3.

You may need to change the fonts used in botex.tex, since those names
seem not to be the ones most places use now.
