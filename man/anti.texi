@appendix Emacs 19.28 Antinews

  For those users who live backwards in time, here is information about
downgrading to Emacs version 19.28.  We hope you will enjoy the greater
simplicity that results from the absence of certain Emacs 19.29
features.

@itemize @bullet
@item
This version doesn't support Windows NT, or the DEC Alpha.

@item
There is no support for editing formatted text.  The text formatter
@TeX{} does a much better job of formatting than any formatted text
editor; we recommend you learn to use it.

@item
@kbd{C-Mouse-2} now runs the menu for setting the default font.

@item
@key{F1} is no longer an alias for the Help key; you must actually type
@kbd{C-h} if you want help.

@item
Integers and buffer sizes are limited to 24 bits on most machines.  But
as memory gets more expensive, you won't want to edit such large files
any more.

@item
There are no indirect buffers, so you can only display one view of an
outline.  Meanwhile, the prefix key for Outline minor mode is now
@kbd{C-c C-o}.

@item
When you are in Transient Mark mode, incremental search always
deactivates the mark.

@item
Dynamic abbrev completion has been eliminated in 19.28, and some of the
other dynamic abbrev customization features are also gone.

@item
In Dired, Occur mode, Compilation mode, and other such modes, you must
use @kbd{C-c C-c} to select the item point is on.  @key{RET} won't do
it.

@item
@kbd{M-x buffer-menu} now displays the menu buffer in another window.

@item
The VC (version control) package no longer supports CVS or selecting
branches other than the principal branch.

@item
There is no @code{recover-session} command; if Emacs crashes, you simply
have to remember which files you were editing before the crash, and use
@code{recover-file} on the individual files.

@item
In Emacs Lisp mode, @kbd{C-M-x} now lets @code{defvar} operate as it
usually does---setting the value of the variable only if it has no value
yet.  Use @kbd{@key{ESC} @key{ESC}} to evaluate a Lisp expression,
instead of @kbd{M-:}.

@item
GNU-standard long option names are not supported.  (Real hackers prefer
the shorter single-dash names, to save typing.)  All the initial options
must come before all the action options, and whatever initial options
you use must appear in this order: @samp{-t}, @samp{-d}, @samp{-nw},
@samp{-batch}, @samp{-q} or @samp{-no-init-file}, @samp{-no-site-file},
@samp{-u} or @samp{-user}, @samp{-debug-init}.
