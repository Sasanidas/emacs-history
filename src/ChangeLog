	Added variable enable-recursive-minibuffers
	(enable_recursive_minibuffers) so that Real Men may confuse
	themselves.  (Some commands such as c-h f can also use it) (This

	Define tt.t_padspeed, minimum speed at which padding needed (pb#).

	Do not assume ^M and ^J can be used unless `cr' or 'do' or `nl'
	says so.
	?? Make second arg to tputs always number of LINES below cursor
	because the termcap documentation says so.  Is this right ??

	its own hairy heuristics!  Moby quoting (past the c compiler, and
	then past substitute-command-keys) added.

	* fileio.c: added optional third arg ok-if-exists to
	rename-file, make-symbolic-link, add-name-to-file and copy-file.

		scroll up all the lines that fit below bp.
	xdisp.c: introduce num_contin, to display tabs right in contin. lines
	doc.c: define substitute-command-keys, using crl@purdue's code.

	editfns.c: Put in code for & in fullname,
		under AMPERSAND_FULL_NAME flag.
	lisp.h: Install NO_UNION_TYPE flag in lisp.h.
		This means XMARKBIT can no longer be on left side of =.

		instead.
	alloc.c, marker.c: use XMARK, XUNMARK, XSETMARKBIT where needed.
	TrmTERM.c: Ignore `xs' termcap flag.
